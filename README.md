# Ukelele Hero

During my junior year at CHC, I was in the robotics class, a do-anything project-based class. This was the first of many projects - albeit a pretty complicated one to start the year off. I distinctly remember procrastination being a large issue at the time, and putting off this project until the day it was due. The result was underwhelming. While functioning, it was jittery and failed to register inputs in some cases.
